        "abstract": "This systematic review examines 42 workplace nutrition intervention programs conducted between 2010 and 2023. Results show that structured meal planning programs reduced employee BMI by an average of 1.8 points over 12 months, with 67% of participants reporting improved dietary habits and self-rated health. Programs combining meal recommendations with educational workshops showed 23% higher adherence rates than meal-only interventions. The most effective programs offered diverse menu options accommodating at least three dietary restriction categories.",

Employees who received weekly evidence-based meal plans showed significant improvements in self-reported energy levels (p<0.001) and a 15% reduction in sick days over 6 months. High-protein lunch options were associated with improved afternoon productivity scores. The study found that workplace nutrition programs with budgets between $30-$40 per employee per week achieved optimal cost-effectiveness ratios.",

Employees who regularly chose vegetarian meals showed 12% lower cholesterol levels compared to the control group. Employees adhering to the low-sodium dietary intervention demonstrated a mean blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic.

Our study of 15 corporate wellness intervention programs found that organizations using structured dietary preference surveys had 35% higher program participation rates. Programs that updated menus quarterly based on survey feedback retained 78% of participants after one year, compared to 45% retention in static programs. The most successful surveys included questions about dietary restrictions, meal timing preferences, budget comfort levels, and interest in educational components like cooking workshops.",
