"""
Preprocess for arxiv-latex-review task (Teamly variant).
- Clears and injects papers into arxiv.papers and arxiv_latex.papers.
- Clears gsheet schema so the agent starts fresh.
- Ensures a Teamly space exists for the knowledge-base page and clears any
  leftover paper pages from previous runs (idempotency).

We intentionally do NOT pre-create the answer page/sheet/doc — the agent must
produce them itself so the evaluation actually exercises the agent's work.
