            "Large pre-trained language models store factual knowledge in their parameters but their ability "
            "to access and manipulate knowledge is limited. We explore retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) "
            "models that combine parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation.\n\n"
            "## Introduction\n\n"
            "Knowledge-intensive NLP tasks such as question answering, fact verification, and dialogue "
            "require accessing large amounts of world knowledge. Traditional approaches rely on structured "
            "knowledge bases, but these are expensive to build and maintain. We propose RAG, which combines "
            "a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model with a dense retrieval component.\n\n"
            "## Methodology\n\n"
            "RAG models combine a pre-trained retriever (DPR) with a pre-trained generator (BART). "
            "The retriever uses a bi-encoder architecture to retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge "
            "source. We propose two variants: RAG-Sequence, which uses the same retrieved document for "
            "the entire generated sequence, and RAG-Token, which can use different documents for each token. "
            "The model is trained end-to-end by marginalizing over the retrieved documents.\n\n"
            "## Experiments\n\n"
            "We evaluate RAG on open-domain question answering, abstractive question answering, Jeopardy "
            "question generation, and fact verification. RAG achieves state-of-the-art results on three "
            "open-domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract "
            "architectures. On the Natural Questions dataset, RAG achieves 44.5 exact match, a new state-of-the-art."

            "As RAG systems move to production, practitioners face engineering challenges in chunking, "
            "embedding, retrieval design, and evaluation. We present a systematic framework for building "
            "robust RAG systems covering the full lifecycle.\n\n"
            "## Introduction\n\n"
            "The success of RAG in research settings has led to widespread adoption in industry. However, "
            "production RAG systems require careful engineering decisions that are not well documented in "
            "the literature. This paper bridges the gap between academic RAG research and practical system "
            "building by providing a comprehensive engineering guide.\n\n"
            "## Methodology\n\n"
            "We organize RAG system design into five pillars: data ingestion (document parsing, chunking "
            "strategies, metadata extraction), indexing (embedding model selection, vector database design, "
            "hybrid search with BM25), retrieval pipeline (query understanding, multi-stage retrieval, "
            "re-ranking), generation (prompt engineering, context window management, citation generation), "
            "and evaluation (automated metrics, human evaluation, regression testing). We conduct ablation "
            "studies on each component to quantify their impact.\n\n"
            "## Experiments\n\n"
            "Our experiments across three domains (legal, medical, technical documentation) show that "
            "chunking strategy has the largest impact on retrieval quality (up to 23% improvement), "
            "followed by embedding model choice (15% improvement) and re-ranking (12% improvement). "
