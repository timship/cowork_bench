            "We explore how generating a chain of thought -- a series of intermediate reasoning "
            "steps -- significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex "
            "reasoning.\n\n"
            "## Introduction\n\n"
            "Scaling up language models has been shown to improve performance on many NLP tasks. "
            "However, scaling alone has not proven sufficient for achieving strong performance on "
            "challenging tasks that require multi-step reasoning, such as math word problems and "
            "commonsense reasoning. We propose chain-of-thought prompting, where a few chain of "
            "thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting.\n\n"
            "## Method\n\n"
            "Chain-of-thought prompting augments each exemplar in few-shot prompting with a chain "
            "of thought -- a coherent series of intermediate reasoning steps leading to the final "
            "answer. This allows the model to decompose complex problems into intermediate steps "
            "that are each individually simpler. The key insight is that by providing a few examples "
            "of step-by-step reasoning, the model learns to generate similar reasoning traces.\n\n"
            "## Experiments\n\n"
            "We evaluate chain-of-thought prompting on arithmetic reasoning (GSM8K, SVAMP, ASDiv, "
            "AQuA, MAWPS), commonsense reasoning (CSQA, StrategyQA), and symbolic reasoning tasks. "
            "On GSM8K, chain-of-thought prompting with PaLM 540B achieves 56.9% accuracy compared "
            "to standard prompting at 17.9%. The method is an emergent ability that arises at "
            "sufficient model scale (approximately 100B parameters).\n\n"
            "## Conclusion\n\n"
            "Chain-of-thought prompting is a simple yet effective method for eliciting multi-step "
            "reasoning in large language models. It requires no fine-tuning and can be applied to "
            "any sufficiently large language model through few-shot prompting."

            "## Introduction\n\n"
            "While chain-of-thought prompting enables step-by-step reasoning, it follows a single "
            "linear path without the ability to explore alternatives or backtrack. Inspired by the "
            "dual-process theory of human cognition, we propose Tree of Thoughts which allows "
            "deliberate planning and search over the space of possible reasoning paths.\n\n"
            "## Framework\n\n"
            "ToT defines a thought as a coherent language sequence that serves as an intermediate "
            "reasoning step. The framework has four key components: (1) thought decomposition, "
            "(2) thought generation using either sampling or proposal prompting, (3) state "
            "evaluation using value or vote prompting, and (4) search algorithms (BFS or DFS). "
            "The LM serves as both the generator and evaluator of thoughts.\n\n"
            "## Experiments\n\n"
            "We evaluate ToT on three novel tasks: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini "
            "Crosswords. On Game of 24, ToT with GPT-4 achieves 74% success rate compared to "
            "4% for chain-of-thought prompting. On Creative Writing, ToT produces more coherent "
            "passages as judged by GPT-4 evaluation. On Mini Crosswords, ToT solves 60% of games "
            "compared to 16% for best-of-100 CoT sampling.\n\n"

            "## Introduction\n\n"
            "Chain-of-thought prompting has shown promise for complex reasoning tasks, but "
            "typically uses greedy decoding which commits to a single reasoning path. We observe "
            "that complex reasoning tasks often admit multiple valid reasoning paths leading to "
            "the correct answer. Self-consistency exploits this intuition by sampling multiple "
            "reasoning paths and aggregating the answers.\n\n"
            "## Method\n\n"
            "Self-consistency works in three steps: (1) prompt the language model with chain-of-thought "
            "exemplars, (2) sample multiple diverse reasoning paths from the decoder by using a "
            "non-zero temperature, (3) marginalize over the reasoning paths by selecting the most "
            "frequent answer (majority voting). The method is unsupervised and requires no additional "
            "training or fine-tuning.\n\n"
            "## Experiments\n\n"
            "Self-consistency substantially improves over chain-of-thought prompting on arithmetic "
            "(GSM8K: +17.9%), commonsense (ARC: +3.9%), and symbolic reasoning benchmarks. "
            "With PaLM 540B, self-consistency achieves 74.4% on GSM8K, surpassing the previous "
            "best of 56.9% from standard chain-of-thought. Performance improves with more samples "
            "up to approximately 40 paths.\n\n"

            "## Introduction\n\n"
            "As language models are increasingly used for complex reasoning, ensuring the reliability "
            "of each reasoning step becomes crucial. Outcome-based reward models (ORMs) only provide "
            "feedback on the final answer, while process-based reward models (PRMs) evaluate each "
            "intermediate step. We hypothesize that process supervision leads to more reliable "
            "reasoning by catching errors early in the chain of thought.\n\n"
            "## Method\n\n"
            "We train process reward models (PRMs) by collecting human labels on each step of "
            "model-generated solutions. For each step, annotators label whether it is correct, "
            "incorrect, or neutral. We compare PRMs against ORMs trained only on final answer "
            "correctness. Both models are used as verifiers to select among multiple candidate "
            "solutions generated by a base model.\n\n"
            "## Experiments\n\n"
            "On the MATH benchmark, the PRM-based approach achieves 78.2% accuracy compared to "
            "72.4% for ORM-based verification and 53.2% for majority voting. Process supervision "
            "produces more interpretable reward signals, as each step receives an individual score. "
            "We also release PRM800K, a dataset of 800K step-level human feedback labels.\n\n"
            "## Conclusion\n\n"
            "Process supervision is a more effective paradigm for training reward models that "
