Our method formulates NAS as a continuous optimization problem over both network weights and architectural topology, enabling gradient-based search through the space of network structures. We introduce a topology loss function that encourages efficient connectivity patterns. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate that our approach discovers architectures achieving 97.8% and 79.2% top-1 accuracy respectively, while requiring 3x fewer search GPU-hours than existing methods.",
