            "The cross-entropy loss L follows a power law: L(N) = (N_c/N)^alpha_N where N is model parameters "
            "and N_c is a constant. Similarly for dataset size and compute. The exponents are approximately "

            "## Experiments\n\n"
            "We trained over 1000 models spanning 3 orders of magnitude in scale. Results confirm that larger "
            "models trained on more data with more compute consistently achieve lower loss.\n\n"
            "## Conclusion\n\n"
