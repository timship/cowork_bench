"""
Preprocess for yt-fireship-scholarly-ppt-gsheet-email task.

Clears and injects:
- 5 papers into scholarly.arxiv_papers and scholarly.scholar_papers
- 2 emails (from research@ai-group.org and team@lab.edu)
- Clears gsheet tables

NOTE: youtube schema is READ-ONLY. This preprocess does NOT touch youtube.videos
or youtube.channels. The task uses the existing Fireship channel data in the DB.
