            "We explore how generating a chain of thought significantly improves the ability "
            "of large language models to perform complex reasoning.\n\n"
            "## Introduction\n\n"
            "Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range "
            "of NLP tasks. However, their ability to perform multi-step reasoning remains a key "
            "challenge. Prior work has shown that scaling model size alone does not reliably improve "
            "reasoning performance. In this paper, we propose chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a "
            "simple method that elicits reasoning by providing exemplars with intermediate reasoning "
            "steps in the prompt.\n\n"
            "## Methodology\n\n"
            "Chain-of-thought prompting augments few-shot exemplars with a series of intermediate "
            "natural language reasoning steps that lead to the final answer. Rather than providing "
            "input-output pairs alone, each exemplar includes a chain of thought that decomposes "
            "the problem into sequential steps. We evaluate this approach using standard few-shot "
            "prompting with manually written chain-of-thought annotations. The key insight is that "
            "the model learns to decompose problems by imitating the reasoning patterns shown in "
            "the exemplars. We test on arithmetic tasks (GSM8K, SVAMP, ASDiv, AQuA, MAWPS), "
            "commonsense reasoning (CSQA, StrategyQA), and symbolic reasoning (last letter "
            "concatenation, coin flip).\n\n"
            "## Experiments\n\n"
            "Chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all benchmarks tested. On "
            "GSM8K, PaLM 540B with chain-of-thought achieves 56.9% accuracy compared to 17.9% "
            "with standard prompting. The improvement is more pronounced for larger models, "
            "suggesting an emergent ability. On commonsense reasoning benchmarks, chain-of-thought "
            "prompting achieves new state-of-the-art results without any task-specific fine-tuning.\n\n"
            "## Conclusion\n\n"
            "Chain-of-thought prompting is a simple and broadly applicable method that significantly "
            "improves the reasoning abilities of large language models across arithmetic, commonsense, "
            "and symbolic reasoning tasks."

            "prompting and enables exploration over coherent units of text as intermediate reasoning steps.\n\n"
            "## Introduction\n\n"
            "While chain-of-thought prompting has shown promise for improving reasoning, it still "
            "generates reasoning in a linear, left-to-right fashion without the ability to explore "
            "alternative paths or backtrack. Human problem-solving often involves considering multiple "
            "approaches, evaluating partial solutions, and revising strategy. Tree of Thoughts brings "
            "these capabilities to language models by structuring the reasoning process as a search "
            "over a tree of possible thought sequences.\n\n"
            "## Methodology\n\n"
            "Tree of Thoughts frames problem solving as a search over a tree, where each node represents "
            "a partial solution (a thought). The framework consists of four components: (1) thought "
            "decomposition that breaks problems into coherent thought steps, (2) thought generation that "
            "proposes candidate next thoughts using either sampling or proposal prompting, (3) state "
            "evaluation that uses the LM to assess the promise of partial solutions via value prompting "
            "or voting, and (4) search algorithms (BFS or DFS) that navigate the tree to find solutions. "
            "Unlike chain-of-thought which produces a single linear reasoning chain, ToT explores multiple "
            "reasoning paths in parallel and can backtrack from unpromising branches.\n\n"
            "## Experiments\n\n"
            "We evaluate ToT on three novel tasks requiring deliberate planning: Game of 24, Creative "
            "Writing, and Mini Crosswords. On Game of 24, GPT-4 with ToT achieves a 74% success rate "
            "compared to 4% with chain-of-thought. On Creative Writing, human evaluators preferred ToT "
            "generations 41% of the time versus 21% for CoT outputs.\n\n"
            "## Conclusion\n\n"
            "Tree of Thoughts provides a principled framework for deliberate problem solving that "
            "significantly extends the reasoning capabilities of large language models beyond linear "
            "chain-of-thought."

            "Chain-of-thought prompting has shown remarkable success in enabling language models to "
            "perform step-by-step reasoning. However, the standard approach uses greedy decoding, which "
            "selects only the most likely token at each step. This can lead to suboptimal reasoning "
            "paths. We observe that complex reasoning problems often have multiple valid solution paths "
            "that all arrive at the same correct answer. Self-consistency exploits this property by "
            "sampling multiple reasoning paths and aggregating their answers.\n\n"
            "## Methodology\n\n"
            "Self-consistency operates in three steps: (1) prompt the language model with chain-of-thought "
            "exemplars as in standard CoT prompting, (2) sample multiple diverse reasoning paths from the "
            "language model by using a sampling temperature instead of greedy decoding, and (3) aggregate "

            "that correct reasoning paths tend to converge on the right answer while incorrect paths are "

            "Large language models have shown remarkable progress on mathematical reasoning tasks "

            "step (process supervision)? This paper presents a thorough comparison of these two "
            "approaches and demonstrates the superiority of process supervision.\n\n"

            "We train process reward models (PRMs) that assign a correctness score to each step in "

            "# Scaling LLM Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning\n\n"
            "## Abstract\n\n"
            "We study scaling reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning, "
            "proposing a novel curriculum learning strategy with PPO.\n\n"
            "## Introduction\n\n"
            "While prompting-based methods like chain-of-thought and tree of thoughts have shown "
            "promise for improving reasoning, they do not fundamentally change the model's reasoning "
            "capabilities. Reinforcement learning offers a path to genuinely improving the model's "
            "internal reasoning abilities through iterative training with reward signals. This paper "
            "explores how RL can be effectively scaled to train strong reasoning models.\n\n"
            "## Methodology\n\n"
            "Our approach combines three key components: (1) a reward model trained on human "
            "preferences over reasoning traces that provides step-level feedback, (2) proximal policy "
            "optimization (PPO) for stable policy updates that prevent catastrophic forgetting, and "
            "(3) a curriculum learning strategy that gradually increases problem difficulty during "
            "training. The curriculum starts with simple single-step problems and progressively "
            "introduces more complex multi-step reasoning tasks. We also employ rejection sampling "
            "to generate high-quality training trajectories and use a KL penalty to maintain "
            "generation diversity.\n\n"
            "## Experiments\n\n"
            "On the MATH benchmark, our RL-trained model achieves 67.3% accuracy compared to 52.9% "
            "for the supervised fine-tuned baseline. On ARC-challenge, we achieve 92.1% accuracy, "
            "surpassing prior state-of-the-art. Our scaling analysis reveals that RL training compute "
            "follows a log-linear relationship with reasoning performance improvement, and that larger "
            "models benefit more from RL training in terms of absolute performance gains.\n\n"
            "## Conclusion\n\n"
            "Reinforcement learning provides a powerful framework for scaling reasoning capabilities "
            "in LLMs, with curriculum learning and careful optimization being key to success."
