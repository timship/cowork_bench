"""
Preprocess for arxiv-latex-analysis-teamly-word task.

Injects 3 papers into arxiv.papers and arxiv_latex.papers.
Ensures a Teamly space exists for the agent to create paper pages in, and
clears any paper pages left over from previous runs (idempotency).
Clears email tables.

Note: unlike the original task we do NOT pre-create the answer pages — the
agent must create them in Teamly itself, so the check actually tests the agent.

Prerequisites:
  - PostgreSQL cowork_gym database running on localhost:5432
  - Teamly schema seeded (db/zzz_teamly_after_init.sql)
