        "summary": "We revisit the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics through the lens of modern decoherence theory. Quantum branching is analyzed using density matrix formalism and pointer states. We argue that decoherence provides a natural mechanism for the emergence of classical branches from quantum superpositions, resolving key objections to the Everettian framework.",

Replicator dynamics, invasion analysis, and spatial games are used to study the emergence and stability of cooperative behavior. Results are validated against empirical data from microbial communities and animal social groups.",
