The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.",

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.",

We present a replication study of BERT pretraining that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained.",

We introduce a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format.",
