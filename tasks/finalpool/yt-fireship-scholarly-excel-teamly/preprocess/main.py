"""
Preprocess for yt-fireship-scholarly-excel-teamly task.

Injects 18 academic papers into scholarly.arxiv_papers AND
scholarly.scholar_papers:
  - 2 papers for topic: AI and Large Language Models
  - 2 papers for topic: Linux and Systems
  - 2 papers for topic: Software Engineering
  - 2 papers for topic: Hardware and Computing
  - 2 papers for topic: Security
  - 3 noise papers on unrelated topics

Citation counts are only retrievable via the scholarly `search-google-scholar`
tool, which reads scholarly.scholar_papers — so we inject there as well, with
the per-paper citation_count, otherwise the task is not honestly solvable.

YouTube data is read-only and pre-populated.

Teamly (RU corporate knowledge base, replaces Notion): we ensure a space exists
for the agent to create the "Tech Content Research Bridge" page in, and clear
any such page left over from previous runs (idempotency). We intentionally do
NOT pre-create the page nor the xlsx — the agent must produce them itself.

Prerequisites:
  - PostgreSQL cowork_gym database running on localhost:5432
  - Teamly schema seeded (db/zzz_teamly_after_init.sql)
