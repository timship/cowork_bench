"""
Preprocess for arxiv-research-tracker-teamly task.
- Clears and injects 5 target papers + 2 noise papers into
  arxiv.papers, scholarly.arxiv_papers, scholarly.scholar_papers.
- Ensures a Teamly space exists for the agent to create the tracker page in,
  and clears any tracker pages left over from previous runs (idempotency).

We intentionally do NOT pre-create the answer page nor the xlsx — the agent
must produce them itself so the evaluation actually tests the agent.

Prerequisites:
  - PostgreSQL cowork_gym database running on localhost:5432
  - Teamly schema seeded (db/zzz_teamly_after_init.sql)
